# ESG Rating and Financial performance of SP-500
This project examine the relationship between Sustainalytics Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risk ratings and
the financial performance of US S&P 500 listed firms.
The methodology included web scraping for data collection, and data wrangling. 
For analysis, correlations are used to examine the relationship between firms' ESG risk ratings, 
institutional shareholdings, and profit margins, which reveals some interesting insights.
In our regression model, the dependent variable (profit margin) is modeled as a third-degree polynomial in the independent variable (overall ESG risk rating).
Polynomial regression fits the nonlinear relationship between ESG risk rating and the profit margin,
such that the ESG risk levels may explain the S&P 500 index's profit margins.
